	<h1> Lab 9: JavaScript for the Web </h1>

<h2>Challenge</h2>
<p> Experiment with DOM manipulation.</p>

<h2>Problems</h2>
<p> Our main challenges during this lab were minor technical issues with some of
	our code malfunctioning such as our CSS and our JavaScript, however we were able
	to resolve them.

<h2>Results</h2>
<p> Here's our html. <p>

<h3> Our JavaScript : </h3>
<img src="img/lab9image.png" style="float:left; margin:15px; border:0"
		width="700" height="700">

<div id="content">
	<script type="text/javascript" src="js/lab.js"></script>
	</div>
